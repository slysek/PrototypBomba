# Atomic bomb simulation

## Overview
PrototypBomba is a project focused on simulating and analyzing bomb models using Java. The application provides a graphical interface and backend logic for creating, modifying, and simulating various bomb scenarios.

## Features
- **Graphical Interface**: Intuitive GUI for easy interaction.
- **Simulation Engine**: Backend logic to simulate bomb behavior and outcomes.
- **Resource Management**: Manage and load resources needed for simulations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/slysek/PrototypBomba.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build the project and run `SymBomb-1.0.exe` for the executable version.

## Usage
- Launch the application using `SymBomb-1.0.exe`.
- Use the interface to create and configure bomb models.
- Run simulations and analyze the results through the graphical interface.

## Repository Structure
- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
- **resources/**: Contains resources such as images and configuration files.
